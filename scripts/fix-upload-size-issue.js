Image Upload Size Issue Diagnosis:

Problem:
1. 413 (Content Too Large) error when uploading images
2. Server returns non-JSON response causing parsing error
3. Error occurs before reaching application code

Possible Causes:
1. Server-level body size limit (Vercel, nginx, etc.)
2. Proxy or CDN restrictions
3. File size exceeds platform limits

Solutions:

1. Reduce Image Size (Client-side):
   - Compress images before upload
   - Resize images to appropriate dimensions
   - Limit file size to under 5MB

2. Server Configuration:
   - For Vercel: Check function size limits
   - For nginx: Increase client_max_body_size
   - For Apache: Increase LimitRequestBody

3. Improved Error Handling (ALREADY IMPLEMENTED):
   - Added client-side file size validation
   - Added proper error response parsing
   - Added user-friendly error messages

Immediate Actions:
1. Try uploading a smaller image (< 2MB)
2. Check hosting platform documentation for body size limits
3. Consider implementing image compression before upload

For Vercel deployments:
- Free tier: 100MB function payload limit
- Pro tier: 100MB function payload limit
- Enterprise: Configurable limits

The 413 error suggests the file is larger than the server's configured limit.
