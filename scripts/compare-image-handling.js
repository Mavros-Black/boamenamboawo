Blog Posts vs Programs Image Handling:

Blog Posts:
1. Field name in database: image_url
2. Field name in frontend: featured_image
3. Upload process:
   - Image uploaded to /api/upload
   - Response URL stored in form state
   - Form state correctly updated with URL
   - PUT endpoint properly called for updates
   - Image displayed on public page with error handling

Programs:
1. Field name in database: image_url
2. Field name in frontend: image_url
3. Upload process:
   - Image uploaded to /api/upload
   - Response URL stored in form state (FIXED)
   - Form state correctly updated with URL (FIXED)
   - PUT endpoint properly called for updates (FIXED)
   - Image displayed on public page with error handling (ENHANCED)

Key Fixes Made:
1. Implemented proper PUT API endpoint call for program updates
2. Enhanced error handling for image display on public page
3. Ensured form state is properly updated with uploaded image URLs
